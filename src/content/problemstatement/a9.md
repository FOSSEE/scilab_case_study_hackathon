Number: 9
heading: "AI/ML Model Builder and Training Interface
"
para: "Create a node-based interface for building and training machine learning models. The application should allow users to build models by visually connecting different processing steps and training algorithms. The system should include:
"
item: 
- name: "Node Types: Include nodes for data preprocessing (normalization, feature extraction), model layers (e.g., Dense, Convolutional, LSTM), and training operations (e.g., loss functions, optimizers)."
- name: "Model Visualization: Allow users to see a graphical representation of the model architecture, similar to how neural network layers are visualized in tools like Keras or TensorFlow."
- name: "Parameter Adjustment: Enable users to configure parameters for each node, such as the number of neurons in a layer or the learning rate for an optimizer."
- name: "Training and Testing: Allow users to input training data, initiate model training, and visualize performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, loss) in real time."
- name: "Export/Import Models: Allow users to export the trained model in a format compatible with other frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) and import pre-existing models to modify their structure."
