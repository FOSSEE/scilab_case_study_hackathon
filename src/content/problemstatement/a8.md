heading: "Visual Programming Environment for Image Filters"
para: "Create a node-based GUI for designing and applying image filters. The application should allow users to visually connect different nodes to build a custom image processing pipeline. The system should include:"
item: 
- name: "Node Types: Include basic nodes for common image processing tasks such as blur, sharpen, grayscale conversion, edge detection, and color adjustments."
- name: "Node Customization: Allow users to configure each nodeâ€™s parameters, such as filter strength, color balance, and kernel size, using sliders or input fields."
- name: "Node Connections: Enable users to connect nodes with simple drag-and-drop functionality to define the flow of image data."
- name: "Real-time Preview: Show the result of the processing in real time, updating the image as nodes are added or modified."
- name: "Undo/Redo: Implement undo and redo functionality to manage changes to the node graph."
